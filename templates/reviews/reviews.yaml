  - quote: "I have worked with Amber Techel more than ten times and I hope to continue to work with her regularly. We have been able to make a great range of photographs. She is special to work with because she has great acting skills. When we are trying for a mood or emotion she can usually deliver it and she is willing to work until we get it. The other quality about her that stands out is that she has ideas of her own that she brings to every shoot. Some of the best photographs we have made have resulted from her ideas. Finally, she is a nice person."
