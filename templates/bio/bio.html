                    <span class="timeline-date">1995 - 2008</span>
                    <p>Amber Lee Techel was born on May 3rd, 1995 in the small town of Gaylord, Michigan to Darlene Techel, assisted by her grandparents Barbara and Fredrick Techel. At the early age of 3, her grandfather (Papa) took her to one of his weekly accordion lessons at the local Musik Haus where Amber sang to a few polkas as he played. People started to crowd the door to see who was singing, which led to her starting singing lessons.</p>
                    <p>Amber's first performance was at age 3 at a retirement home party. Seeing how fast she learned, they added instruments every 2-3 years including piano, accordion, guitar, flute, piccolo, harmonica, Irish whistle, and select percussion instruments. She traveled around Michigan as the lead vocalist of the Musik Haus band: the Polka Pals, recording her first studio album at age 7.</p>
                    <p>In addition to music lessons, her family started her in training for dance, acting, composing, writing, and art with local artists and family members, winning numerous talent awards in her community.</p>
